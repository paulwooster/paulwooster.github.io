PixiJS is written in typescript and seems a lot of examples assume you are running node.js and webpack to compile overall code

I had wanted to keep development config as simple as possible, but I just gave in and installed npm.  We'll see how this goes.

Doing that through sudo was simple, but installed a whole bunch of stuff that seemingly is quite dated. Probably going to try downloading node.js direclty.
